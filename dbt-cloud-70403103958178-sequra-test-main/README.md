Here are the test results for the analytics engineer position at SeQura.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created a Snowflake trial account to store and test the data for part 1.
You can check the data using the following reader account:

Username: maximerosa
Password: Sequratest123!
You can query the table using the worksheet 'SETUP'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I created a trial DBT Cloud account to gather all the SQL queries and organize the transformations, you can check the final models here.

I had a few questions:
- Why is a customer considered recurring if he makes two purchases from the same merchant in the same month? It could be a case of two successive orders that don't demonstrate loyalty.
- Why isn't the default ratio requested on the output of part 2?

I did my best and am excited to meet you at a future meeting.
